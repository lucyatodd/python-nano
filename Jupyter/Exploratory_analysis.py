# # PISA Data Exploration and Analysis
# ## by Lucy Todd
# 
# ## Preliminary Wrangling
# 
# > The data set I have chosen to use is the PISA 2012 assessment. I will be focussing on the effects and relationships of different factors on student maths scores in the United Kingdom and Japan.

# In[1]:


# import all packages and set plots to be embedded inline
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sb

get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')


# In[2]:


#I'm now going to read in the raw data
df_pisa_uncut = pd.read_csv('pisa2012.csv', encoding = "ISO-8859-1")


# In[3]:


#For this investigation I will only be comparing the UK and Japan, so I am going to cut the dataset to make it smaller easier to investigate
df_pisa = df_pisa_uncut[(df_pisa_uncut.CNT == 'United Kingdom') | (df_pisa_uncut.CNT == 'Japan')].copy()


# In[4]:


#I will also import the dictionary that will tell me what the column headers mean
df_dict = pd.read_csv('pisa_dict.csv', encoding = "ISO-8859-1")


# ### What is the structure of your dataset?
# 
# > The pisa dataset is structured as a row of data for each student that took part. There are columns for their demographic data (such as country, gender, school), columns for their answers to the survey questions (such as spent doing homework) and their final scores in each of the tests they undertook.
# 
# > I will also be using the data dictionary that PISA provide in order to determine the names of different columns.
# 
# ### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?
# 
# > As this is such a huge dataset I have chosen to focus my exploration on two countries (Japan and the United Kingdom), and will be looking at the effects of different factors on student maths scores. I will be investigation the relationship between the way in which the students answer the survey questions, and their maths score. As well as the effect of gender and country on their survey answers and maths score.
# 
# ### What features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?
# 
# > I will be looking the the answers to the survey questions that each student answered. I will start with the questions on what technology each student has at home, and will go onto their participation in outside of school study to see the effect that this has on their maths score. To find each students maths score I will use the mean value of the 5 plausible values provided in the dataset. The plausible values are statistical imputations based on a predictive model to calculate each students score.

# In[5]:


#I am going to calculate the average of the plausible values to use the maths score for each student
df_pisa['maths score'] = df_pisa[['PV1MATH', 'PV2MATH', 'PV3MATH', 'PV4MATH', 'PV5MATH']].mean(axis = 1)

# <font color=dodgerblue>We can see from the box plot above that the group with the highest median maths score is Japan/male, then Japan/female, UK/male, UK/female.
# 
# The interquartile ranges for each group look fairly similar in size, meaning that for each group there is a similar amount of agreement between scores. The whiskers for each plot are also a similar size, but vary in upper and lower limits.
# 
# For each group there are quite a lot of lower outliers, however it is interesting that the UK plots have more outliers at the top. This may however be due to a larger sample size for the UK.</font>

# <font color=dodgerblue>The lollipop chart shows the percentage of boys and girls who own each technology item. We can see that a higher proportion of girls own each of the technologies than boys respectively. This is not the case for video games consoles, where it is clear that boys are far more likely to own one than girls. Also, a higher proportion of boys own a USB stick. The technologies that most boys and girls own are a cell phone with intermet, internet connection and an Mp3/Mp4 player. Both genders are less likely to own a cell phone without internet, an Ebook reader or a tablet computer.
# 
# Laptop and desktop computer ownership is comparatively low, which is interesting when we think back to the graph of average maths score by computer ownership. Those students with a computer of some sort scored significantly higher than those without. Potentially if more students had access to a computer maths scores in general would increase.

# <font color=dodgerblue>From these two charts we can see that around 60% of students in all four groups do homework outside of school.
# 
# In the UK guided homework, homework with a parent and homework on a computer are far more common than in Japan.
# 
# In Japan there is not a lot of difference between the proportion of girls and boys who do home work with a personal tutor, commercial company or computer. In the UK a higher proportion of girls take part in all of these activities than boys respectively.
# 
# Aside from this, for Japan and the UK more girls proportionally take part in all of the out of school study activities than boys.</font>
